# reader.js
A lightweight EPUB reader in JavaScript with annotation support

## Usage
Download and navigate to *index.html?book=gatsby*.

Annotation support is based on [Annotator](http://annotatorjs.org/) and is automatically set up to interface with [AnnotateIt](http://annotateit.org/).

## Customisation
`Annotator.prototype.annotationColour` in *vendor/annotator-1.2.10.js* can be modified to set custom colours/classes for annotations depending on their content.
