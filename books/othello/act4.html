<h4>Scene I. Cyprus. Before the castle.</h4>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Othello and Iago</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Will you think so?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   Think so, Iago!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> What,<br />
To kiss in private?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> An unauthorized kiss.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Or to be naked with her friend in bed<br />
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!<br />
It is hypocrisy against the devil:<br />
They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,<br />
The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> So they do nothing, ’tis a venial slip:<br />
But if I give my wife a handkerchief&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> What then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Why, then, ’tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,<br />
She may, I think, bestow’t on any man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> She is protectress of her honour too:<br />
May she give that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Her honour is an essence that’s not seen;<br />
They have it very oft that have it not:<br />
But, for the handkerchief&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.<br />
Thou said’st, it comes o’er my memory,<br />
As doth the raven o’er the infected house,<br />
Boding to all — he had my handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Ay, what of that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   That’s not so good now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> What,<br />
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?<br />
Or heard him say — as knaves be such abroad,<br />
Who having, by their own importunate suit,<br />
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,<br />
Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose<br />
But they must blab&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Hath he said any thing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,<br />
No more than he’ll unswear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> What hath he said?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> ’Faith, that he did — I know not what he did.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> What? what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Lie&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   With her?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> With her, on her; what you will.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when they belie her. Lie with her! that’s fulsome. — Handkerchief — confessions — handkerchief! — To confess, and be hanged for his labour; — first, to be hanged, and then to confess. — I tremble at it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction. It is not words that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips. — Is’t possible? — Confess — handkerchief! — O devil!&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="stage">Falls in a trance</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Work on,<br />
My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;<br />
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,<br />
All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!<br />
My lord, I say! Othello!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Cassio</span>
</p>

<p>How now, Cassio!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> My lord is fall’n into an epilepsy:<br />
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Rub him about the temples.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> No, forbear;<br />
The lethargy must have his quiet course:<br />
If not, he foams at mouth and by and by<br />
Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:<br />
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,<br />
He will recover straight: when he is gone,<br />
I would on great occasion speak with you.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit Cassio</span>
</p>

<p>How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Dost thou mock me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span>   I mock you! no, by heaven.<br />
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> A horned man’s a monster and a beast.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> There’s many a beast then in a populous city,<br />
And many a civil monster.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Did he confess it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span>   Good sir, be a man;<br />
Think every bearded fellow that’s but yoked<br />
May draw with you: there’s millions now alive<br />
That nightly lie in those unproper beds<br />
Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.<br />
O, ’tis the spite of hell, the fiend’s arch-mock,<br />
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,<br />
And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;<br />
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O, thou art wise; ’tis certain.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Stand you awhile apart;<br />
Confine yourself but in a patient list.<br />
Whilst you were here o’erwhelmed with your grief —<br />
A passion most unsuiting such a man —<br />
Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,<br />
And laid good ’scuse upon your ecstasy,<br />
Bade him anon return and here speak with me;<br />
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,<br />
And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,<br />
That dwell in every region of his face;<br />
For I will make him tell the tale anew,<br />
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when<br />
He hath, and is again to cope your wife:<br />
I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;<br />
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,<br />
And nothing of a man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Dost thou hear, Iago?<br />
I will be found most cunning in my patience;<br />
But — dost thou hear? — most bloody.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> That’s not amiss;<br />
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?</p>

<p><span class="stage">Othello retires</span>
</p>

<p>Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,<br />
A housewife that by selling her desires<br />
Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature<br />
That dotes on Cassio; as ’tis the strumpet’s plague<br />
To beguile many and be beguiled by one:<br />
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain<br />
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:</p>

<p><span class="stage">Re-enter Cassio</span>
</p>

<p>As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;<br />
And his unbookish jealousy must construe<br />
Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures and light behavior,<br />
Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> The worser that you give me the addition<br />
Whose want even kills me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on’t.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Speaking lower</span>
</p>

<p>Now, if this suit lay in Bianco’s power,<br />
How quickly should you speed!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Alas, poor caitiff!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Look, how he laughs already!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I never knew woman love man so.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Alas, poor rogue! I think, i’ faith, she loves me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Do you hear, Cassio?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Now he importunes him<br />
To tell it o’er: go to; well said, well said.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> She gives it out that you shall marry hey:<br />
Do you intend it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome. Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> ’Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Prithee, say true.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I am a very villain else.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Have you scored me? Well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> This is the monkey’s own giving out: she is persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and flattery, not out of my promise.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> She was here even now; she haunts me in every place. I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble, and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Crying ‘O dear Cassio!’ as it were: his gesture imports it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales, and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O, I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall throw it to.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Well, I must leave her company.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Before me! look, where she comes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> ’Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Bianca</span>
</p>

<p>What do you mean by this haunting of me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the work? — A likely piece of work, that you should find it in your chamber, and not know who left it there! This is some minx’s token, and I must take out the work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever you had it, I’ll take out no work on’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> An you’ll come to supper to-night, you may; an you will not, come when you are next prepared for.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> After her, after her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> ’Faith, I must; she’ll rail in the street else.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Will you sup there?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> ’Faith, I intend so.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain speak with you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Prithee, come; will you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Go to; say no more.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit Cassio</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> <span class="stage">[Advancing]</span> How shall I murder him, Iago?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O Iago!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> And did you see the handkerchief?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Was that mine?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I would have him nine years a-killing.<br />
A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Nay, you must forget that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night; for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by an emperor’s side and command him tasks.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Nay, that’s not your way.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high and plenteous wit and invention:—</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> She’s the worse for all this.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so gentle a condition!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Ay, too gentle.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Nay, that’s certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!<br />
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes near nobody.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> O, ’tis foul in her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> With mine officer!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> That’s fouler.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I’ll not expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even the bed she hath contaminated.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you shall hear more by midnight.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Excellent good.</p>

<p><span class="stage">A trumpet within</span>
</p>

<p>What trumpet is that same?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Something from Venice, sure. ’Tis Lodovico<br />
Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Lodovico, Desdemona, and Attendants</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Save you, worthy general!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> With all my heart, sir.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> The duke and senators of Venice greet you.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Gives him a letter</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Opens the letter, and reads</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> And what’s the news, good cousin Lodovico?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I am very glad to see you, signior<br />
Welcome to Cyprus.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Lives, sir.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Cousin, there’s fall’n between him and my lord<br />
An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Are you sure of that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> My lord?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> <span class="stage">[Reads]</span> ‘This fail you not to do, as you will —’</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> He did not call; he’s busy in the paper.<br />
Is there division ’twixt my lord and Cassio?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> A most unhappy one: I would do much<br />
To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Fire and brimstone!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> My lord?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   Are you wise?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> What, is he angry?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span>   May be the letter moved him;<br />
For, as I think, they do command him home,<br />
Deputing Cassio in his government.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Trust me, I am glad on’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Indeed!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> My lord?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I am glad to see you mad.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Why, sweet Othello&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> <span class="stage">[Striking her]</span> Devil!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I have not deserved this.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,<br />
Though I should swear I saw’t: ’tis very much:<br />
Make her amends; she weeps.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O devil, devil!<br />
If that the earth could teem with woman’s tears,<br />
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.<br />
Out of my sight!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I will not stay to offend you.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Going</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Truly, an obedient lady:<br />
I do beseech your lordship, call her back.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Mistress!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span>   My lord?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> What would you with her, sir?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Who, I, my lord?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:<br />
Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,<br />
And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;<br />
And she’s obedient, as you say, obedient,<br />
Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.<br />
Concerning this, sir — O well-painted passion! —<br />
I am commanded home. Get you away;<br />
I’ll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,<br />
And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit Desdemona</span>
</p>

<p>Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,<br />
I do entreat that we may sup together:<br />
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. — Goats and monkeys!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate<br />
Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature<br />
Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue<br />
The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,<br />
Could neither graze nor pierce?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> He is much changed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> He’s that he is: I may not breathe my censure<br />
What he might be: if what he might he is not,<br />
I would to heaven he were!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> What, strike his wife!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> ’Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew<br />
That stroke would prove the worst!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Is it his use?<br />
Or did the letters work upon his blood,<br />
And new-create this fault?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Alas, alas!<br />
It is not honesty in me to speak<br />
What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,<br />
And his own courses will denote him so<br />
That I may save my speech: do but go after,<br />
And mark how he continues.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> I am sorry that I am deceived in him.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exeunt</span>

<h4>Scene II. A room in the castle.</h4>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Othello and Emilia</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> You have seen nothing then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> But then I saw no harm, and then I heard<br />
Each syllable that breath made up between them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> What, did they never whisper?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Never, my lord.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Nor send you out o’ the way?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Never.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Never, my lord.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> That’s strange.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,<br />
Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,<br />
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.<br />
If any wretch have put this in your head,<br />
Let heaven requite it with the serpent’s curse!<br />
For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,<br />
There’s no man happy; the purest of their wives<br />
Is foul as slander.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Bid her come hither: go.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit Emilia</span>
</p>

<p>She says enough; yet she’s a simple bawd<br />
That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,<br />
A closet lock and key of villanous secrets<br />
And yet she’ll kneel and pray; I have seen her do’t.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Desdemona with Emilia</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> My lord, what is your will?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Pray, chuck, come hither.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> What is your pleasure?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Let me see your eyes;<br />
Look in my face.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span>   What horrible fancy’s this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> <span class="stage">[To Emilia]</span> Some of your function, mistress;<br />
Leave procreants alone and shut the door;<br />
Cough, or cry ‘hem,’ if any body come:<br />
Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit Emilia</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?<br />
I understand a fury in your words.<br />
But not the words.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Why, what art thou?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Your wife, my lord; your true<br />
And loyal wife.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   Come, swear it, damn thyself<br />
Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves<br />
Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn’d:<br />
Swear thou art honest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Heaven doth truly know it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O Desdemona! away! away! away!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?<br />
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?<br />
If haply you my father do suspect<br />
An instrument of this your calling back,<br />
Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,<br />
Why, I have lost him too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Had it pleased heaven<br />
To try me with affliction; had they rain’d<br />
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.<br />
Steep’d me in poverty to the very lips,<br />
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,<br />
I should have found in some place of my soul<br />
A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me<br />
A fixed figure for the time of scorn<br />
To point his slow unmoving finger at!<br />
Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:<br />
But there, where I have garner’d up my heart,<br />
Where either I must live, or bear no life;<br />
The fountain from the which my current runs,<br />
Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!<br />
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads<br />
To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,<br />
Patience, thou young and rose-lipp’d cherubin —<br />
Ay, there, look grim as hell!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,<br />
That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,<br />
Who art so lovely fair and smell’st so sweet<br />
That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne’er been born!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,<br />
Made to write ‘whore’ upon? What committed!<br />
Committed! O thou public commoner!<br />
I should make very forges of my cheeks,<br />
That would to cinders burn up modesty,<br />
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!<br />
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,<br />
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets<br />
Is hush’d within the hollow mine of earth,<br />
And will not hear it. What committed!<br />
Impudent strumpet!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span>   By heaven, you do me wrong.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Are you not a strumpet?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> No, as I am a Christian:<br />
If to preserve this vessel for my lord<br />
From any other foul unlawful touch<br />
Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> What, not a whore?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span>   No, as I shall be saved.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Is’t possible?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span>   O, heaven forgive us!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I cry you mercy, then:<br />
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice<br />
That married with Othello.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Raising his voice</span>
</p>

<p>You, mistress,<br />
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,<br />
And keep the gate of hell!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Re-enter Emilia</span>
</p>

<p>You, you, ay, you!<br />
We have done our course; there’s money for your pains:<br />
I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?<br />
How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> ’Faith, half asleep.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Good madam, what’s the matter with my lord?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> With who?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Why, with my lord, madam.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Who is thy lord?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span>   He that is yours, sweet lady.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;<br />
I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,<br />
But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight<br />
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;<br />
And call thy husband hither.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Here’s a change indeed!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> ’Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.<br />
How have I been behaved, that he might stick<br />
The small’st opinion on my least misuse?</p>

<p><span class="stage">Re-enter Emilia with Iago</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> What is your pleasure, madam?<br />
How is’t with you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes<br />
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:<br />
He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,<br />
I am a child to chiding.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> What’s the matter, lady?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.<br />
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,<br />
As true hearts cannot bear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Am I that name, Iago?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> What name, fair lady?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Such as she says my lord did say I was.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> He call’d her whore: a beggar in his drink<br />
Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Why did he so?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I do not know; I am sure I am none such.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Hath she forsook so many noble matches,<br />
Her father and her country and her friends,<br />
To be call’d whore? would it not make one weep?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> It is my wretched fortune.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Beshrew him for’t!<br />
How comes this trick upon him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Nay, heaven doth know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> I will be hang’d, if some eternal villain,<br />
Some busy and insinuating rogue,<br />
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,<br />
Have not devised this slander; I’ll be hang’d else.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> If any such there be, heaven pardon him!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!<br />
Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?<br />
What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?<br />
The Moor’s abused by some most villanous knave,<br />
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.<br />
O heaven, that such companions thou’ldst unfold,<br />
And put in every honest hand a whip<br />
To lash the rascals naked through the world<br />
Even from the east to the west!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Speak within door.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was<br />
That turn’d your wit the seamy side without,<br />
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> You are a fool; go to.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> O good Iago,<br />
What shall I do to win my lord again?<br />
Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,<br />
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:<br />
If e’er my will did trespass ’gainst his love,<br />
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,<br />
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,<br />
Delighted them in any other form;<br />
Or that I do not yet, and ever did.<br />
And ever will — though he do shake me off<br />
To beggarly divorcement — love him dearly,<br />
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;<br />
And his unkindness may defeat my life,<br />
But never taint my love. I cannot say ‘whore:’<br />
It does abhor me now I speak the word;<br />
To do the act that might the addition earn<br />
Not the world’s mass of vanity could make me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I pray you, be content; ’tis but his humour:<br />
The business of the state does him offence,<br />
And he does chide with you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> If ’twere no other&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> ’Tis but so, I warrant.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Trumpets within</span>
</p>

<p>Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!<br />
The messengers of Venice stay the meat;<br />
Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia</span>
</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Roderigo</span>
</p>

<p>How now, Roderigo!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> What in the contrary?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago; and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Will you hear me, Roderigo?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> ’Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and performances are no kin together.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> You charge me most unjustly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist: you have told me she hath received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Well; go to; very well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor ’tis not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin to find myself fobbed in it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Very well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> I tell you ’tis not very well. I will make myself known to Desdemona: if she will return me my jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> You have said now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this instant to build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> It hath not appeared.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> How do you mean, removing of him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place; knocking out his brains.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> And that you would have me to do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows to waste: about it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> I will hear further reason for this.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> And you shall be satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exeunt</span>

<h4>Scene III. Another room In the castle.</h4>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Othello, Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia and Attendants</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O, pardon me: ’twill do me good to walk.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Your honour is most welcome.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Will you walk, sir?<br />
O— Desdemona&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> My lord?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I will, my lord.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exeunt Othello, Lodovico, and Attendants</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> He says he will return incontinent:<br />
He hath commanded me to go to bed,<br />
And bade me to dismiss you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Dismiss me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.<br />
Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:<br />
We must not now displease him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> I would you had never seen him!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> So would not I my love doth so approve him,<br />
That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns —<br />
Prithee, unpin me — have grace and favour in them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> All’s one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!<br />
If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me<br />
In one of those same sheets.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Come, come you talk.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> My mother had a maid call’d Barbara:<br />
She was in love, and he she loved proved mad<br />
And did forsake her: she had a song of ‘willow;’<br />
An old thing ’twas, but it express’d her fortune,<br />
And she died singing it: that song to-night<br />
Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,<br />
But to go hang my head all at one side,<br />
And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Shall I go fetch your night-gown?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> No, unpin me here.<br />
This Lodovico is a proper man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> A very handsome man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> He speaks well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> <span class="stage">[Singing]</span> The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,<br />
Sing all a green willow:<br />
Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,<br />
Sing willow, willow, willow:<br />
The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur’d her moans;<br />
Sing willow, willow, willow;<br />
Her salt tears fell from her, and soften’d the stones;<br />
Lay by these:—</p>

<p><span class="stage">Singing</span>
</p>

<p>Sing willow, willow, willow;<br />
Prithee, hie thee; he’ll come anon:—</p>

<p><span class="stage">Singing</span>
</p>

<p>Sing all a green willow must be my garland.<br />
Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,-<br />
Nay, that’s not next. — Hark! who is’t that knocks?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> It’s the wind.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> <span class="stage">[Singing]</span> I call’d my love false love; but what said he then?<br />
Sing willow, willow, willow:<br />
If I court moe women, you’ll couch with moe men!<br />
So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;<br />
Doth that bode weeping?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> ’Tis neither here nor there.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!<br />
Dost thou in conscience think — tell me, Emilia —<br />
That there be women do abuse their husbands<br />
In such gross kind?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> There be some such, no question.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Why, would not you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> No, by this heavenly light!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Nor I neither by this heavenly light;<br />
I might do’t as well i’ the dark.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> The world’s a huge thing: it is a great price.<br />
For a small vice.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> In troth, I think thou wouldst not.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> In troth, I think I should; and undo’t when I had done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but for the whole world — why, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong<br />
For the whole world.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Why the wrong is but a wrong i’ the world: and having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I do not think there is any such woman.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for.<br />
But I do think it is their husbands’ faults<br />
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,<br />
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,<br />
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,<br />
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,<br />
Or scant our former having in despite;<br />
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,<br />
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know<br />
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell<br />
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,<br />
As husbands have. What is it that they do<br />
When they change us for others? Is it sport?<br />
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?<br />
I think it doth: is’t frailty that thus errs?<br />
It is so too: and have not we affections,<br />
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?<br />
Then let them use us well: else let them know,<br />
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,<br />
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!</p>
