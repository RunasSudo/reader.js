<h4>Scene I. Before the castle.</h4>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Cassio and some Musicians</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Masters, play here; I will content your pains;<br />
Something that’s brief; and bid ‘Good morrow, general.’</p>

<p><span class="stage">Music</span>
</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Clown</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i’ the nose thus?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">First Musician</span> How, sir, how!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">First Musician</span> Ay, marry, are they, sir.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> O, thereby hangs a tail.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">First Musician</span> Whereby hangs a tale, sir?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know. But, masters, here’s money for you: and the general so likes your music, that he desires you, for love’s sake, to make no more noise with it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">First Musician</span> Well, sir, we will not.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> If you have any music that may not be heard, to’t again: but, as they say to hear music the general does not greatly care.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">First Musician</span> We have none such, sir.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I’ll away: go; vanish into air; away!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exeunt Musicians</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Dost thou hear, my honest friend?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There’s a poor piece of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends the general’s wife be stirring, tell her there’s one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech: wilt thou do this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Do, good my friend.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit Clown</span>
</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Iago</span>
</p>

<p>In happy time, Iago.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> You have not been a-bed, then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Why, no; the day had broke<br />
Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,<br />
To send in to your wife: my suit to her<br />
Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona<br />
Procure me some access.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I’ll send her to you presently;<br />
And I’ll devise a mean to draw the Moor<br />
Out of the way, that your converse and business<br />
May be more free.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> I humbly thank you for’t.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit Iago</span>
</p>

<p>I never knew<br />
A Florentine more kind and honest.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Emilia</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry<br />
For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.<br />
The general and his wife are talking of it;<br />
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,<br />
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,<br />
And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom<br />
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you<br />
And needs no other suitor but his likings<br />
To take the safest occasion by the front<br />
To bring you in again.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Yet, I beseech you,<br />
If you think fit, or that it may be done,<br />
Give me advantage of some brief discourse<br />
With Desdemona alone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Pray you, come in;<br />
I will bestow you where you shall have time<br />
To speak your bosom freely.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> I am much bound to you.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exeunt</span>

<h4>Scene II. A room in the castle.</h4>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;<br />
And by him do my duties to the senate:<br />
That done, I will be walking on the works;<br />
Repair there to me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Well, my good lord, I’ll do’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see’t?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gentleman</span> We’ll wait upon your lordship.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exeunt</span>

<h4>Scene III. The garden of the castle.</h4>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and Emilia</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do<br />
All my abilities in thy behalf.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,<br />
As if the case were his.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> O, that’s an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,<br />
But I will have my lord and you again<br />
As friendly as you were.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Bounteous madam,<br />
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,<br />
He’s never any thing but your true servant.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I know’t; I thank you. You do love my lord:<br />
You have known him long; and be you well assured<br />
He shall in strangeness stand no further off<br />
Than in a polite distance.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Ay, but, lady,<br />
That policy may either last so long,<br />
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,<br />
Or breed itself so out of circumstance,<br />
That, I being absent and my place supplied,<br />
My general will forget my love and service.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Do not doubt that; before Emilia here<br />
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,<br />
If I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it<br />
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;<br />
I’ll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;<br />
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;<br />
I’ll intermingle every thing he does<br />
With Cassio’s suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;<br />
For thy solicitor shall rather die<br />
Than give thy cause away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Madam, here comes my lord.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Madam, I’ll take my leave.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Why, stay, and hear me speak.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,<br />
Unfit for mine own purposes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Well, do your discretion.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit Cassio</span>
</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Othello and Iago</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Ha! I like not that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> What dost thou say?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Nothing, my lord: or if — I know not what.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,<br />
That he would steal away so guilty-like,<br />
Seeing you coming.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   I do believe ’twas he.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> How now, my lord!<br />
I have been talking with a suitor here,<br />
A man that languishes in your displeasure.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Who is’t you mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,<br />
If I have any grace or power to move you,<br />
His present reconciliation take;<br />
For if he be not one that truly loves you,<br />
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,<br />
I have no judgment in an honest face:<br />
I prithee, call him back.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Went he hence now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Ay, sooth; so humbled<br />
That he hath left part of his grief with me,<br />
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> But shall’t be shortly?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> The sooner, sweet, for you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Shall’t be to-night at supper?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> No, not to-night.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> To-morrow dinner, then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I shall not dine at home;<br />
I meet the captains at the citadel.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;<br />
On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:<br />
I prithee, name the time, but let it not<br />
Exceed three days: in faith, he’s penitent;<br />
And yet his trespass, in our common reason —<br />
Save that, they say, the wars must make examples<br />
Out of their best — is not almost a fault<br />
To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?<br />
Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,<br />
What you would ask me, that I should deny,<br />
Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,<br />
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,<br />
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,<br />
Hath ta’en your part; to have so much to do<br />
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;<br />
I will deny thee nothing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Why, this is not a boon;<br />
’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,<br />
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,<br />
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit<br />
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit<br />
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,<br />
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight<br />
And fearful to be granted.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I will deny thee nothing:<br />
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,<br />
To leave me but a little to myself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Farewell, my Desdemona: I’ll come to thee straight.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;<br />
Whate’er you be, I am obedient.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,<br />
But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,<br />
Chaos is come again.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> My noble lord&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   What dost thou say, Iago?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Did Michael Cassio, when you woo’d my lady,<br />
Know of your love?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> But for a satisfaction of my thought;<br />
No further harm.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   Why of thy thought, Iago?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I did not think he had been acquainted with her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O, yes; and went between us very oft.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Indeed!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Indeed! ay, indeed: discern’st thou aught in that?<br />
Is he not honest?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Honest, my lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   Honest! ay, honest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> My lord, for aught I know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> What dost thou think?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Think, my lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Think, my lord!<br />
By heaven, he echoes me,<br />
As if there were some monster in his thought<br />
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:<br />
I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,<br />
When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?<br />
And when I told thee he was of my counsel<br />
In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst ‘Indeed!’<br />
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,<br />
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain<br />
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,<br />
Show me thy thought.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> My lord, you know I love you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I think thou dost;<br />
And, for I know thou’rt full of love and honesty,<br />
And weigh’st thy words before thou givest them breath,<br />
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:<br />
For such things in a false disloyal knave<br />
Are tricks of custom, but in a man that’s just<br />
They are close delations, working from the heart<br />
That passion cannot rule.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> For Michael Cassio,<br />
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I think so too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span>   Men should be what they seem;<br />
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Certain, men should be what they seem.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Why, then, I think Cassio’s an honest man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Nay, yet there’s more in this:<br />
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,<br />
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts<br />
The worst of words.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Good my lord, pardon me:<br />
Though I am bound to every act of duty,<br />
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.<br />
Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;<br />
As where’s that palace whereinto foul things<br />
Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,<br />
But some uncleanly apprehensions<br />
Keep leets and law-days and in session sit<br />
With meditations lawful?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,<br />
If thou but think’st him wrong’d and makest his ear<br />
A stranger to thy thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I do beseech you —<br />
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,<br />
As, I confess, it is my nature’s plague<br />
To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy<br />
Shapes faults that are not — that your wisdom yet,<br />
From one that so imperfectly conceits,<br />
Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble<br />
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.<br />
It were not for your quiet nor your good,<br />
Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,<br />
To let you know my thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> What dost thou mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,<br />
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:<br />
Who steals my purse steals trash; ’tis something, nothing;<br />
’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands:<br />
But he that filches from me my good name<br />
Robs me of that which not enriches him<br />
And makes me poor indeed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;<br />
Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Ha!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;<br />
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock<br />
The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss<br />
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;<br />
But, O, what damned minutes tells he o’er<br />
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O misery!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Poor and content is rich and rich enough,<br />
But riches fineless is as poor as winter<br />
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.<br />
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend<br />
From jealousy!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   Why, why is this?<br />
Think’st thou I’ld make a lie of jealousy,<br />
To follow still the changes of the moon<br />
With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt<br />
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,<br />
When I shall turn the business of my soul<br />
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,<br />
Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous<br />
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,<br />
Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;<br />
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:<br />
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw<br />
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;<br />
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;<br />
I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;<br />
And on the proof, there is no more but this —<br />
Away at once with love or jealousy!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason<br />
To show the love and duty that I bear you<br />
With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,<br />
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.<br />
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;<br />
Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:<br />
I would not have your free and noble nature,<br />
Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to’t:<br />
I know our country disposition well;<br />
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks<br />
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience<br />
Is not to leave’t undone, but keep’t unknown.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Dost thou say so?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> She did deceive her father, marrying you;<br />
And when she seem’d to shake and fear your looks,<br />
She loved them most.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> And so she did.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Why, go to then;<br />
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,<br />
To seal her father’s eyes up close as oak-<br />
He thought ’twas witchcraft — but I am much to blame;<br />
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon<br />
For too much loving you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I am bound to thee for ever.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I see this hath a little dash’d your spirits.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Not a jot, not a jot.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I’ faith, I fear it has.<br />
I hope you will consider what is spoke<br />
Comes from my love. But I do see you’re moved:<br />
I am to pray you not to strain my speech<br />
To grosser issues nor to larger reach<br />
Than to suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I will not.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span>   Should you do so, my lord,<br />
My speech should fall into such vile success<br />
As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio’s my worthy friend —<br />
My lord, I see you’re moved.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> No, not much moved:<br />
I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Long live she so! and long live you to think so!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> And yet, how nature erring from itself&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Ay, there’s the point: as — to be bold with you —<br />
Not to affect many proposed matches<br />
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,<br />
Whereto we see in all things nature tends —<br />
Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,<br />
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.<br />
But pardon me; I do not in position<br />
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear<br />
Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,<br />
May fall to match you with her country forms<br />
And happily repent.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Farewell, farewell:<br />
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;<br />
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> <span class="stage">[Going]</span> My lord, I take my leave.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless<br />
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> <span class="stage">[Returning]</span> My lord, I would I might entreat your honour<br />
To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:<br />
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,<br />
For sure, he fills it up with great ability,<br />
Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,<br />
You shall by that perceive him and his means:<br />
Note, if your lady strain his entertainment<br />
With any strong or vehement importunity;<br />
Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,<br />
Let me be thought too busy in my fears —<br />
As worthy cause I have to fear I am —<br />
And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Fear not my government.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I once more take my leave.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> This fellow’s of exceeding honesty,<br />
And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,<br />
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,<br />
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,<br />
I’ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,<br />
To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black<br />
And have not those soft parts of conversation<br />
That chamberers have, or for I am declined<br />
Into the vale of years — yet that’s not much —<br />
She’s gone. I am abused; and my relief<br />
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,<br />
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,<br />
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,<br />
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,<br />
Than keep a corner in the thing I love<br />
For others’ uses. Yet, ’tis the plague of great ones;<br />
Prerogatived are they less than the base;<br />
’Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:<br />
Even then this forked plague is fated to us<br />
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:</p>

<p><span class="stage">Re-enter Desdemona and Emilia</span>
</p>

<p>If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!<br />
I’ll not believe’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> How now, my dear Othello!<br />
Your dinner, and the generous islanders<br />
By you invited, do attend your presence.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I am to blame.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span>   Why do you speak so faintly?<br />
Are you not well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I have a pain upon my forehead here.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> ’Faith, that’s with watching; ’twill away again:<br />
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour<br />
It will be well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   Your napkin is too little:</p>

<p><span class="stage">He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops</span>
</p>

<p>Let it alone. Come, I’ll go in with you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I am very sorry that you are not well.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exeunt Othello and Desdemona</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> I am glad I have found this napkin:<br />
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:<br />
My wayward husband hath a hundred times<br />
Woo’d me to steal it; but she so loves the token,<br />
For he conjured her she should ever keep it,<br />
That she reserves it evermore about her<br />
To kiss and talk to. I’ll have the work ta’en out,<br />
And give’t Iago: what he will do with it<br />
Heaven knows, not I;<br />
I nothing but to please his fantasy.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Re-enter Iago</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> How now! what do you here alone?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> A thing for me? it is a common thing&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Ha!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> To have a foolish wife.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> O, is that all? What will you give me now<br />
For the same handkerchief?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> What handkerchief?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> What handkerchief?<br />
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;<br />
That which so often you did bid me steal.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Hast stol’n it from her?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> No, ’faith; she let it drop by negligence.<br />
And, to the advantage, I, being here, took’t up.<br />
Look, here it is.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span>   A good wench; give it me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> What will you do with ’t, that you have been so earnest To have me filch it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> <span class="stage">[Snatching it]</span> Why, what’s that to you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> If it be not for some purpose of import,<br />
Give’t me again: poor lady, she’ll run mad<br />
When she shall lack it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Be not acknown on ’t; I have use for it.<br />
Go, leave me.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit Emilia</span>
</p>

<p>I will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin,<br />
And let him find it. Trifles light as air<br />
Are to the jealous confirmations strong<br />
As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.<br />
The Moor already changes with my poison:<br />
Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.<br />
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,<br />
But with a little act upon the blood.<br />
Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:<br />
Look, where he comes!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Re-enter Othello</span>
</p>

<p>Not poppy, nor mandragora,<br />
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,<br />
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep<br />
Which thou owedst yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Ha! ha! false to me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Why, how now, general! no more of that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:<br />
I swear ’tis better to be much abused<br />
Than but to know’t a little.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> How now, my lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> What sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust?<br />
I saw’t not, thought it not, it harm’d not me:<br />
I slept the next night well, was free and merry;<br />
I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips:<br />
He that is robb’d, not wanting what is stol’n,<br />
Let him not know’t, and he’s not robb’d at all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I am sorry to hear this.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I had been happy, if the general camp,<br />
Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,<br />
So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever<br />
Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!<br />
Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,<br />
That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!<br />
Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,<br />
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,<br />
The royal banner, and all quality,<br />
Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!<br />
And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats<br />
The immortal Jove’s dead clamours counterfeit,<br />
Farewell! Othello’s occupation’s gone!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Is’t possible, my lord?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,<br />
Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:<br />
Or by the worth of man’s eternal soul,<br />
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog<br />
Than answer my waked wrath!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Is’t come to this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Make me to see’t; or, at the least, so prove it,<br />
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop<br />
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> My noble lord&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> If thou dost slander her and torture me,<br />
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;<br />
On horror’s head horrors accumulate;<br />
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;<br />
For nothing canst thou to damnation add<br />
Greater than that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span>   O grace! O heaven forgive me!<br />
Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?<br />
God be wi’ you; take mine office. O wretched fool.<br />
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!<br />
O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,<br />
To be direct and honest is not safe.<br />
I thank you for this profit; and from hence<br />
I’ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I should be wise, for honesty’s a fool<br />
And loses that it works for.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> By the world,<br />
I think my wife be honest and think she is not;<br />
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.<br />
I’ll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh<br />
As Dian’s visage, is now begrimed and black<br />
As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,<br />
Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,<br />
I’ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:<br />
I do repent me that I put it to you.<br />
You would be satisfied?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Would! nay, I will.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?<br />
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on —<br />
Behold her topp’d?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   Death and damnation! O!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> It were a tedious difficulty, I think,<br />
To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,<br />
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster<br />
More than their own! What then? how then?<br />
What shall I say? Where’s satisfaction?<br />
It is impossible you should see this,<br />
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,<br />
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross<br />
As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,<br />
If imputation and strong circumstances,<br />
Which lead directly to the door of truth,<br />
Will give you satisfaction, you may have’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I do not like the office:<br />
But, sith I am enter’d in this cause so far,<br />
Prick’d to’t by foolish honesty and love,<br />
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;<br />
And, being troubled with a raging tooth,<br />
I could not sleep.<br />
There are a kind of men so loose of soul,<br />
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:<br />
One of this kind is Cassio:<br />
In sleep I heard him say ‘sweet Desdemona,<br />
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;’<br />
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,<br />
Cry ‘O sweet creature!’ and then kiss me hard,<br />
As if he pluck’d up kisses by the roots<br />
That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg<br />
Over my thigh, and sigh’d, and kiss’d; and then<br />
Cried ‘Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!’</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O monstrous! monstrous!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Nay, this was but his dream.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> But this denoted a foregone conclusion:<br />
’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> And this may help to thicken other proofs<br />
That do demonstrate thinly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I’ll tear her all to pieces.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;<br />
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,<br />
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief<br />
Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I gave her such a one; ’twas my first gift.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I know not that; but such a handkerchief —<br />
I am sure it was your wife’s — did I to-day<br />
See Cassio wipe his beard with.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> If it be that&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> If it be that, or any that was hers,<br />
It speaks against her with the other proofs.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!<br />
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.<br />
Now do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago;<br />
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.<br />
’Tis gone.<br />
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!<br />
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne<br />
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,<br />
For ’tis of aspics’ tongues!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Yet be content.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O, blood, blood, blood!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,<br />
Whose icy current and compulsive course<br />
Ne’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on<br />
To the Propontic and the Hellespont,<br />
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,<br />
Shall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love,<br />
Till that a capable and wide revenge<br />
Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,</p>

<p><span class="stage">Kneels</span>
</p>

<p>In the due reverence of a sacred vow<br />
I here engage my words.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Do not rise yet.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Kneels</span>
</p>

<p>Witness, you ever-burning lights above,<br />
You elements that clip us round about,<br />
Witness that here Iago doth give up<br />
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,<br />
To wrong’d Othello’s service! Let him command,<br />
And to obey shall be in me remorse,<br />
What bloody business ever.</p>

<p><span class="stage">They rise</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I greet thy love,<br />
Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,<br />
And will upon the instant put thee to’t:<br />
Within these three days let me hear thee say<br />
That Cassio’s not alive.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> My friend is dead; ’tis done at your request:<br />
But let her live.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!<br />
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,<br />
To furnish me with some swift means of death<br />
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I am your own for ever.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exeunt</span>

<h4>Scene IV. Before the castle.</h4>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Desdemona, Emilia, and Clown</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> I dare not say he lies any where.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Why, man?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> He’s a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies, is stabbing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Go to: where lodges he?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Can any thing be made of this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> I will catechise the world for him; that is, make questions, and by them answer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Clown</span> To do this is within the compass of man’s wit: and therefore I will attempt the doing it.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> I know not, madam.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse<br />
Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor<br />
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness<br />
As jealous creatures are, it were enough<br />
To put him to ill thinking.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Is he not jealous?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Who, he? I think the sun where he was born<br />
Drew all such humours from him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Look, where he comes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I will not leave him now till Cassio<br />
Be call’d to him.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Othello</span>
</p>

<p>How is’t with you, my lord</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Well, my good lady.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Aside</span>
</p>

<p>O, hardness to dissemble! —<br />
How do you, Desdemona?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Well, my good lord.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:<br />
Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires<br />
A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,<br />
Much castigation, exercise devout;<br />
For here’s a young and sweating devil here,<br />
That commonly rebels. ’Tis a good hand,<br />
A frank one.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span>   You may, indeed, say so;<br />
For ’twas that hand that gave away my heart.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;<br />
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> What promise, chuck?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;<br />
Lend me thy handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Here, my lord.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> That which I gave you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I have it not about me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Not?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span>   No, indeed, my lord.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> That is a fault.<br />
That handkerchief<br />
Did an Egyptian to my mother give;<br />
She was a charmer, and could almost read<br />
The thoughts of people: she told her, while she kept it,<br />
’Twould make her amiable and subdue my father<br />
Entirely to her love, but if she lost it<br />
Or made gift of it, my father’s eye<br />
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt<br />
After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;<br />
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,<br />
To give it her. I did so: and take heed on’t;<br />
Make it a darling like your precious eye;<br />
To lose’t or give’t away were such perdition<br />
As nothing else could match.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Is’t possible?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> ’Tis true: there’s magic in the web of it:<br />
A sibyl, that had number’d in the world<br />
The sun to course two hundred compasses,<br />
In her prophetic fury sew’d the work;<br />
The worms were hallow’d that did breed the silk;<br />
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful<br />
Conserved of maidens’ hearts.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Indeed! is’t true?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Most veritable; therefore look to’t well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Then would to God that I had never seen’t!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Ha! wherefore?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Why do you speak so startingly and rash?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Is’t lost? is’t gone? speak, is it out o’ the way?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Heaven bless us!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Say you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> It is not lost; but what an if it were?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> How!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I say, it is not lost.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Fetch’t, let me see’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.<br />
This is a trick to put me from my suit:<br />
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Come, come;<br />
You’ll never meet a more sufficient man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> The handkerchief!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span>   I pray, talk me of Cassio.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> The handkerchief!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span>   A man that all his time<br />
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,<br />
Shared dangers with you&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> The handkerchief!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> In sooth, you are to blame.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Away!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Is not this man jealous?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I ne’er saw this before.<br />
Sure, there’s some wonder in this handkerchief:<br />
I am most unhappy in the loss of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> ’Tis not a year or two shows us a man:<br />
They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;<br />
To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,<br />
They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Cassio and Iago</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> There is no other way; ’tis she must do’t:<br />
And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> How now, good Cassio! what’s the news with you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you<br />
That by your virtuous means I may again<br />
Exist, and be a member of his love<br />
Whom I with all the office of my heart<br />
Entirely honour: I would not be delay’d.<br />
If my offence be of such mortal kind<br />
That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,<br />
Nor purposed merit in futurity,<br />
Can ransom me into his love again,<br />
But to know so must be my benefit;<br />
So shall I clothe me in a forced content,<br />
And shut myself up in some other course,<br />
To fortune’s alms.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span>   Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!<br />
My advocation is not now in tune;<br />
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,<br />
Were he in favour as in humour alter’d.<br />
So help me every spirit sanctified,<br />
As I have spoken for you all my best<br />
And stood within the blank of his displeasure<br />
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:<br />
What I can do I will; and more I will<br />
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Is my lord angry?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span>   He went hence but now,<br />
And certainly in strange unquietness.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,<br />
When it hath blown his ranks into the air,<br />
And, like the devil, from his very arm<br />
Puff’d his own brother:— and can he be angry?<br />
Something of moment then: I will go meet him:<br />
There’s matter in’t indeed, if he be angry.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I prithee, do so.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit Iago</span>
</p>

<p>Something, sure, of state,<br />
Either from Venice, or some unhatch’d practise<br />
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,<br />
Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases<br />
Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things,<br />
Though great ones are their object. ’Tis even so;<br />
For let our finger ache, and it indues<br />
Our other healthful members even to that sense<br />
Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,<br />
Nor of them look for such observances<br />
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,<br />
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,<br />
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;<br />
But now I find I had suborn’d the witness,<br />
And he’s indicted falsely.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,<br />
And no conception nor no jealous toy<br />
Concerning you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Alas the day! I never gave him cause.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> But jealous souls will not be answer’d so;<br />
They are not ever jealous for the cause,<br />
But jealous for they are jealous: ’tis a monster<br />
Begot upon itself, born on itself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Heaven keep that monster from Othello’s mind!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Lady, amen.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:<br />
If I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit<br />
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> I humbly thank your ladyship.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia</span>
</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Bianca</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> Save you, friend Cassio!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> What make you from home?<br />
How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?<br />
I’ faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.<br />
What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?<br />
Eight score eight hours? and lovers’ absent hours,<br />
More tedious than the dial eight score times?<br />
O weary reckoning!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span>   Pardon me, Bianca:<br />
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press’d:<br />
But I shall, in a more continuate time,<br />
Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,</p>

<p><span class="stage">Giving her Desdemona’s handkerchief</span>
</p>

<p>Take me this work out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> O Cassio, whence came this?<br />
This is some token from a newer friend:<br />
To the felt absence now I feel a cause:<br />
Is’t come to this? Well, well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Go to, woman!<br />
Throw your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth,<br />
From whence you have them. You are jealous now<br />
That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:<br />
No, in good troth, Bianca.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> Why, whose is it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.<br />
I like the work well: ere it be demanded —<br />
As like enough it will — I’ld have it copied:<br />
Take it, and do’t; and leave me for this time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> Leave you! wherefore?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> I do attend here on the general;<br />
And think it no addition, nor my wish,<br />
To have him see me woman’d.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> Why, I pray you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Not that I love you not.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> But that you do not love me.<br />
I pray you, bring me on the way a little,<br />
And say if I shall see you soon at night.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> ’Tis but a little way that I can bring you;<br />
For I attend here: but I’ll see you soon.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> ’Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.</p>
