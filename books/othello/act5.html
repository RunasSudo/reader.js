<h4>Scene I. Cyprus. A street.</h4>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Iago and Roderigo</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:<br />
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:<br />
Quick, quick; fear nothing; I’ll be at thy elbow:<br />
It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,<br />
And fix most firm thy resolution.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> Be near at hand; I may miscarry in’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Retires</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> I have no great devotion to the deed;<br />
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:<br />
’Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I have rubb’d this young quat almost to the sense,<br />
And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,<br />
Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,<br />
Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,<br />
He calls me to a restitution large<br />
Of gold and jewels that I bobb’d from him,<br />
As gifts to Desdemona;<br />
It must not be: if Cassio do remain,<br />
He hath a daily beauty in his life<br />
That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor<br />
May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:<br />
No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Cassio</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> I know his gait, ’tis he. — Villain, thou diest!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Makes a pass at Cassio</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,<br />
But that my coat is better than thou know’st<br />
I will make proof of thine.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Draws, and wounds Roderigo</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> O, I am slain!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Iago from behind wounds Cassio in the leg, and exit</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> I am maim’d for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Falls</span>
</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Othello</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> O, villain that I am!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> It is even so.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> ’Tis he:— O brave Iago, honest and just,<br />
That hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong!<br />
Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,<br />
And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.<br />
Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;<br />
Thy bed, lust-stain’d, shall with lust’s blood be spotted.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exit</span>
</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Lodovico and Gratiano</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> ’Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> O, help!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Hark!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> O wretched villain!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:<br />
These may be counterfeits: let’s think’t unsafe<br />
To come in to the cry without more help.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Hark!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Re-enter Iago, with a light</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> Here’s one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Who’s there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> We do not know.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span>   Did not you hear a cry?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Here, here! for heaven’s sake, help me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> This is Othello’s ancient, as I take it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> What are you here that cry so grievously?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Iago? O, I am spoil’d, undone by villains!<br />
Give me some help.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> I think that one of them is hereabout,<br />
And cannot make away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> O treacherous villains!<br />
What are you there? come in, and give some help.</p>

<p><span class="stage">To Lodovico and Gratiano</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> O, help me here!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> That’s one of them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> O murderous slave! O villain!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Stabs Roderigo</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Roderigo</span> O damn’d Iago! O inhuman dog!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Kill men i’ the dark! — Where be these bloody thieves? —<br />
How silent is this town! — Ho! murder! murder! —<br />
What may you be? are you of good or evil?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> As you shall prove us, praise us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Signior Lodovico?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> He, sir.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I cry you mercy. Here’s Cassio hurt by villains.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> Cassio!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> How is’t, brother!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> My leg is cut in two.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Marry, heaven forbid!<br />
Light, gentlemen; I’ll bind it with my shirt.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Bianca</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> What is the matter, ho? who is’t that cried?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Who is’t that cried!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,<br />
Cassio, Cassio!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect<br />
Who they should be that have thus many led you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,<br />
To bear him easily hence!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash<br />
To be a party in this injury.<br />
Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;<br />
Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?<br />
Alas my friend and my dear countryman<br />
Roderigo! no:— yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> What, of Venice?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Even he, sir; did you know him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> Know him! ay.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;<br />
These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,<br />
That so neglected you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> I am glad to see you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> Roderigo!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> He, he ’tis he.</p>

<p><span class="stage">A chair brought in</span>
</p>

<p>O, that’s well said; the chair!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> Some good man bear him carefully from hence;<br />
I’ll fetch the general’s surgeon.</p>

<p><span class="stage">To Bianca</span>
</p>

<p>For you, mistress,<br />
Save you your labour. He that lies slain here, Cassio,<br />
Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> None in the world; nor do I know the man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> <span class="stage">[To Bianca]</span> What, look you pale? O, bear him out o’ the air.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Cassio and Roderigo are borne off</span>
</p>

<p>Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?<br />
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?<br />
Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.<br />
Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:<br />
Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,<br />
Though tongues were out of use.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Emilia</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> ’Las, what’s the matter? what’s the matter, husband?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Cassio hath here been set on in the dark<br />
By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:<br />
He’s almost slain, and Roderigo dead.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,<br />
Go know of Cassio where he supp’d to-night.</p>

<p><span class="stage">To Bianca</span>
</p>

<p>What, do you shake at that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> He supp’d at my house; but I therefore shake not.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Bianca</span> I am no strumpet; but of life as honest<br />
As you that thus abuse me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> As I! foh! fie upon thee!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Kind gentlemen, let’s go see poor Cassio dress’d.<br />
Come, mistress, you must tell’s another tale.<br />
Emilia run you to the citadel,<br />
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ’d.<br />
Will you go on? I pray.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Aside</span>
</p>

<p>This is the night<br />
That either makes me or fordoes me quite.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exeunt</span>

<h4>Scene II. A bedchamber in the castle: Desdemona in bed asleep;</h4>

<p>a light burning.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Othello</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul —<br />
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars! —<br />
It is the cause. Yet I’ll not shed her blood;<br />
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,<br />
And smooth as monumental alabaster.<br />
Yet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.<br />
Put out the light, and then put out the light:<br />
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,<br />
I can again thy former light restore,<br />
Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,<br />
Thou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature,<br />
I know not where is that Promethean heat<br />
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck’d the rose,<br />
I cannot give it vital growth again.<br />
It must needs wither: I’ll smell it on the tree.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Kissing her</span>
</p>

<p>Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade<br />
Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.<br />
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,<br />
And love thee after. One more, and this the last:<br />
So sweet was ne’er so fatal. I must weep,<br />
But they are cruel tears: this sorrow’s heavenly;<br />
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Who’s there? Othello?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Ay. Desdemona.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Will you come to bed, my lord?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Have you pray’d to-night, Desdemona?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Ay, my lord.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> If you bethink yourself of any crime<br />
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,<br />
Solicit for it straight.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:<br />
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;<br />
No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Talk you of killing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Ay, I do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Then heaven<br />
Have mercy on me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   Amen, with all my heart!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Hum!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then<br />
When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,<br />
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Think on thy sins.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span>   They are loves I bear to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Ay, and for that thou diest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> That death’s unnatural that kills for loving.<br />
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?<br />
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:<br />
These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,<br />
They do not point on me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Peace, and be still!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> I will so. What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee<br />
Thou gavest to Cassio.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> No, by my life and soul!<br />
Send for the man, and ask him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Sweet soul, take heed,<br />
Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Ay, but not yet to die.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Yes, presently:<br />
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;<br />
For to deny each article with oath<br />
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception<br />
That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Then Lord have mercy on me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I say, amen.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> And have you mercy too! I never did<br />
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio<br />
But with such general warranty of heaven<br />
As I might love: I never gave him token.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in’s hand.<br />
O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,<br />
And makest me call what I intend to do<br />
A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:<br />
I saw the handkerchief.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> He found it then;<br />
I never gave it him: send for him hither;<br />
Let him confess a truth.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> He hath confess’d.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> What, my lord?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> That he hath used thee.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> How? unlawfully?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Ay.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> He will not say so.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> No, his mouth is stopp’d;<br />
Honest Iago hath ta’en order for’t.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge<br />
Had stomach for them all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Alas! he is betray’d and I undone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Out, strumpet! weep’st thou for him to my face?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Down, strumpet!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Nay, if you strive&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> But half an hour!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   Being done, there is no pause.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> But while I say one prayer!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> It is too late.</p>

<p><span class="stage">He stifles her</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> <span class="stage">[Within]</span> My lord, my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?<br />
I that am cruel am yet merciful;<br />
I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> <span class="stage">[Within]</span> What, ho! my lord, my lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Who’s there?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> <span class="stage">[Within]</span> O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Yes: ’tis Emilia. By and by. She’s dead.<br />
’Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death. —<br />
The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?<br />
Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were’t good? —<br />
I think she stirs again:— no. What’s best to do?<br />
If she come in, she’ll sure speak to my wife:<br />
My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.<br />
O insupportable! O heavy hour!<br />
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse<br />
Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe<br />
Should yawn at alteration.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> <span class="stage">[Within]</span> I do beseech you<br />
That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;<br />
Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.<br />
Where art thou?</p>

<p><span class="stage">Unlocks the door</span>
</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Emilia</span>
</p>

<p>What’s the matter with thee now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> O, my good lord, yonder’s foul murders done!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> What, now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> But now, my lord.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> It is the very error of the moon;<br />
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,<br />
And makes men mad.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Cassio, my lord, hath kill’d a young Venetian<br />
Call’d Roderigo.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   Roderigo kill’d!<br />
And Cassio kill’d!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> No, Cassio is not kill’d.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Not Cassio kill’d! then murder’s out of tune,<br />
And sweet revenge grows harsh.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> O, falsely, falsely murder’d!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Alas, what cry is that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> That! what?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Out, and alas! that was my lady’s voice.<br />
Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!<br />
Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> A guiltless death I die.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> O, who hath done this deed?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Desdemona</span> Nobody; I myself. Farewell<br />
Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Dies</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Why, how should she be murder’d?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Alas, who knows?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> You heard her say herself, it was not I.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> She said so: I must needs report the truth.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> She’s, like a liar, gone to burning hell:<br />
’Twas I that kill’d her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> O, the more angel she,<br />
And you the blacker devil!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> She turn’d to folly, and she was a whore.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> She was false as water.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Thou art rash as fire, to say<br />
That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.<br />
O, I were damn’d beneath all depth in hell,<br />
But that I did proceed upon just grounds<br />
To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> My husband!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Thy husband.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> That she was false to wedlock?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,<br />
If heaven would make me such another world<br />
Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,<br />
I’ld not have sold her for it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> My husband!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span>   Ay, ’twas he that told me first:<br />
An honest man he is, and hates the slime<br />
That sticks on filthy deeds.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> My husband!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,<br />
My husband say that she was false!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> He, woman;<br />
I say thy husband: dost understand the word?<br />
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> If he say so, may his pernicious soul<br />
Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:<br />
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Ha!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Do thy worst:<br />
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven<br />
Than thou wast worthy her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Peace, you were best.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Thou hast not half that power to do me harm<br />
As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!<br />
As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed —<br />
I care not for thy sword; I’ll make thee known,<br />
Though I lost twenty lives. — Help! help, ho! help!<br />
The Moor hath kill’d my mistress! Murder! murder!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Montano, Gratiano, Iago, and others</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Montano</span> What is the matter? How now, general!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,<br />
That men must lay their murders on your neck.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> What is the matter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Disprove this villain, if thou be’st a man:<br />
He says thou told’st him that his wife was false:<br />
I know thou didst not, thou’rt not such a villain:<br />
Speak, for my heart is full.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I told him what I thought, and told no more<br />
Than what he found himself was apt and true.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> But did you ever tell him she was false?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I did.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;<br />
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.<br />
She false with Cassio! — did you say with Cassio?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:<br />
My mistress here lies murder’d in her bed&#160; —</p>

<p><span class="speaker">All</span> O heavens forfend!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> And your reports have set the murder on.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> ’Tis a strange truth.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Montano</span> O monstrous act!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span>   Villany, villany, villany!<br />
I think upon’t, I think: I smell’t: O villany! —<br />
I thought so then:— I’ll kill myself for grief:—<br />
O villany, villany!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:<br />
’Tis proper I obey him, but not now.<br />
Perchance, Iago, I will ne’er go home.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O! O! O!</p>

<p><span class="stage">He falls on the bed</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span>   Nay, lay thee down and roar;<br />
For thou hast kill’d the sweetest innocent<br />
That e’er did lift up eye.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> <span class="stage">[Rising]</span> O, she was foul!<br />
I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,<br />
Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp’d:<br />
I know this act shows horrible and grim.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father’s dead:<br />
Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief<br />
Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,<br />
This sight would make him do a desperate turn,<br />
Yea, curse his better angel from his side,<br />
And fall to reprobation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> ’Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows<br />
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame<br />
A thousand times committed; Cassio confess’d it:<br />
And she did gratify his amorous works<br />
With that recognizance and pledge of love<br />
Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:<br />
It was a handkerchief, an antique token<br />
My father gave my mother.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> O heaven! O heavenly powers!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Come, hold your peace.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> ’Twill out, ’twill out: I peace!<br />
No, I will speak as liberal as the north:<br />
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,<br />
All, all, cry shame against me, yet I’ll speak.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Be wise, and get you home.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> I will not.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Iago offers to stab Emilia</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> Fie!<br />
Your sword upon a woman?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak’st of<br />
I found by fortune and did give my husband;<br />
For often, with a solemn earnestness,<br />
More than indeed belong’d to such a trifle,<br />
He begg’d of me to steal it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Villanous whore!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,<br />
And I did give’t my husband.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Filth, thou liest!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.<br />
O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool<br />
Do with so good a woman?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Are there no stones in heaven<br />
But what serve for the thunder? — Precious villain!</p>

<p><span class="stage">He runs at Iago Iago, from behind, stabs Emilia, and exit</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> The woman falls; sure, he hath kill’d his wife.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress’ side.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> He’s gone, but his wife’s kill’d.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Montano</span> ’Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,<br />
Which I have here recover’d from the Moor:<br />
Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,<br />
But kill him rather. I’ll after that same villain,<br />
For ’tis a damned slave.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Exeunt Montano and Gratiano</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I am not valiant neither,<br />
But ever puny whipster gets my sword:<br />
But why should honour outlive honesty?<br />
Let it go all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Emilia</span> What did thy song bode, lady?<br />
Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.<br />
And die in music.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Singing</span>
</p>

<p>Willow, willow, willow —<br />
Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;<br />
So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;<br />
So speaking as I think, I die, I die.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Dies</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I have another weapon in this chamber;<br />
It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook’s temper:—<br />
O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> <span class="stage">[Within]</span> If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:<br />
Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Look in upon me then and speak with me,<br />
Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Re-enter Gratiano</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span> What is the matter?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Behold, I have a weapon;<br />
A better never did itself sustain<br />
Upon a soldier’s thigh: I have seen the day,<br />
That, with this little arm and this good sword,<br />
I have made my way through more impediments<br />
Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!<br />
Who can control his fate? ’tis not so now.<br />
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon’d;<br />
Here is my journey’s end, here is my butt,<br />
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.<br />
Do you go back dismay’d? ’tis a lost fear;<br />
Man but a rush against Othello’s breast,<br />
And he retires. Where should Othello go?<br />
Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr’d wench!<br />
Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,<br />
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,<br />
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!<br />
Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!<br />
Whip me, ye devils,<br />
From the possession of this heavenly sight!<br />
Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!<br />
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!<br />
O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!<br />
Oh! Oh! Oh!</p>

<p><span class="stage">Enter Lodovico. Montano, Cassio carried in a chair, and Officers with Iago, prisoner</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> That’s he that was Othello: here I am.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I look down towards his feet; but that’s a fable.<br />
If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Wounds Iago</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Wrench his sword from him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> I bleed, sir; but not kill’d.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I am not sorry neither: I’ld have thee live;<br />
For, in my sense, ’tis happiness to die.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,<br />
Fall’n in the practise of a damned slave,<br />
What shall be said to thee?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Why, any thing:<br />
An honourable murderer, if you will;<br />
For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> This wretch hath part confess’d his villany:<br />
Did you and he consent in Cassio’s death?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Ay.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Dear general, I never gave you cause.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.<br />
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil<br />
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Iago</span> Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:<br />
From this time forth I never will speak word.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> What, not to pray?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span>   Torments will ope your lips.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Well, thou dost best.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Sir, you shall understand what hath befall’n,<br />
Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter<br />
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;<br />
And here another: the one of them imports<br />
The death of Cassio to be undertook<br />
By Roderigo.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O villain!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> Most heathenish and most gross!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> Now here’s another discontented paper,<br />
Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,<br />
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;<br />
But that belike Iago in the interim<br />
Came in and satisfied him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O the pernicious caitiff!<br />
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief<br />
That was my wife’s?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> I found it in my chamber:<br />
And he himself confess’d but even now<br />
That there he dropp’d it for a special purpose<br />
Which wrought to his desire.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> O fool! fool! fool!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> There is besides in Roderigo’s letter,<br />
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him<br />
Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came<br />
That I was cast: and even but now he spake,<br />
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,<br />
Iago set him on.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> You must forsake this room, and go with us:<br />
Your power and your command is taken off,<br />
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,<br />
If there be any cunning cruelty<br />
That can torment him much and hold him long,<br />
It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,<br />
Till that the nature of your fault be known<br />
To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> Soft you; a word or two before you go.<br />
I have done the state some service, and they know’t.<br />
No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,<br />
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,<br />
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,<br />
Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak<br />
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;<br />
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought<br />
Perplex’d in the extreme; of one whose hand,<br />
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away<br />
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,<br />
Albeit unused to the melting mood,<br />
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees<br />
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;<br />
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,<br />
Where a malignant and a turban’d Turk<br />
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,<br />
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,<br />
And smote him, thus.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Stabs himself</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> O bloody period!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Gratiano</span>   All that’s spoke is marr’d.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Othello</span> I kiss’d thee ere I kill’d thee: no way but this;<br />
Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.</p>

<p><span class="stage">Falls on the bed, and dies</span>
</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Cassio</span> This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;<br />
For he was great of heart.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">Lodovico</span> <span class="stage">[To Iago]</span> O Spartan dog,<br />
More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!<br />
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;<br />
This is thy work: the object poisons sight;<br />
Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,<br />
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,<br />
For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,<br />
Remains the censure of this hellish villain;<br />
The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!<br />
Myself will straight aboard: and to the state<br />
This heavy act with heavy heart relate.</p>
